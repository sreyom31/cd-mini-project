# LL1-Parser-Simulator

LL1-Parser-Simulator is a web-based tool that simulates the working of LL(1) parser algorithm. This tool allows the user to input a grammar and a string, and then it generates a parse tree by parsing the input string based on the given grammar. The tool uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface that visualizes the parsing process step by step. 

The LL(1) parser algorithm is implemented using JavaScript, and the parse tree is generated by using HTML and CSS. The simulator also includes features like error handling, grammar checking, and visual feedback to help the user understand the parsing process and identify errors in the input string. 

The simulator can be used by students, researchers, and developers to understand the working of the LL(1) parser algorithm and its implementation in compiler design. It can also be used as a teaching aid to demonstrate how a parser works and how to generate a parse tree. 

Overall, LL1-Parser-Simulator is a useful tool for anyone interested in learning about LL(1) parser and its implementation.
